gdp_cap versus life_exp plot, the GDP and life expectancy data for different countries in 2007. Maybe a scatter plot will be a better alternative?

matplotlib.pyplot package is available as plt

# Change the line plot below to a scatter plot
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)

# Put the x-axis on a logarithmic scale
plt.xscale('log')

# Show plot
plt.show()


2. 
Starting from scratch to  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Building a scatter plot, where pop is mapped on the horizontal axis, and life_exp is mapped on the vertical axis.
Finished the script with plt.show() to actually display the plot. 
the code:
# Import package
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Build Scatter plot
plt.scatter(pop, life_exp)

# Show plot
plt.show()
